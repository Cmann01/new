# Word Occurrence Counter

This is a Python program that reads a text file, identifies unique words, and counts how many times each word occurs in the text. It provides options for customizing the counting process, including case sensitivity, stopwords removal, and excluding specific words.

## Features

- **Word Counting**: The program accurately counts the occurrences of each unique word in the input text file.

- **Case Sensitivity**: You can choose whether the counting should be case-sensitive or case-insensitive.

- **Stopwords Removal**: If desired, you can specify a list of stopwords to be excluded from the word count. Stopwords are common words like "and," "the," "in" that are often excluded when analyzing text.

- **Exclusion List**: You can also specify a list of words to be excluded from the word count. This is useful if you want to exclude specific words from the analysis.

- **Efficiency**: The program efficiently processes large text files by reading them in chunks.

# Real-Time Chat Application

This is a real-time chat application built in Python that allows multiple users to join chat rooms, exchange messages, and share files. The project consists of both server-side and client-side scripts with a graphical user interface for the clients.

## Features

- **Multiple Chat Rooms**: Users can create and join chat rooms, allowing separate conversations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The client-side uses a GUI created with the `tkinter` library for an interactive and user-friendly experience.
- **Timestamps**: Messages are displayed with timestamps.
- **Message History**: Chat history is displayed, including messages sent before joining.
- **File Sharing**: Users can exchange files within the chat rooms.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Messages are delivered in real-time to all clients in the same chat room.

## How to Run

### Server-Side

1. Clone this repository or download the `chat_server.py` file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `chat_server.py`.
3. Run the server script by providing your IP address and a port number as command-line arguments. For example:

```bash
python chat_server.py 127.0.0.1 8080
The server is now running and listening for client connections. Keep the server terminal open.
Client-Side
Clone this repository or download the client.py file.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing client.py.
Run the client script by executing the following command:
bash
Copy code
python client.py
When the client script starts, it will prompt you to enter your name. Enter your desired name and press Enter.

Next, it will ask you to enter the chat room you want to join. You can either create a new room or join an existing one by entering the room name and pressing Enter.

The chat client window will open with the chat room name in the title. You can start chatting by typing messages in the input field at the bottom and pressing Enter or clicking the "Send" button.

You can create additional chat clients by opening new terminal windows and running the client.py script. Each client can join an existing chat room or create a new one.

Messages sent by one client will be received by all clients in the same chat room.

To exit a chat client, simply close its window.

To stop the chat server, go to the server terminal and press Ctrl+C to terminate the server.
