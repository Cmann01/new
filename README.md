# Word Occurrence Counter

This is a Python program that reads a text file, identifies unique words, and counts how many times each word occurs in the text. It provides options for customizing the counting process, including case sensitivity, stopwords removal, and excluding specific words.

## Features

- **Word Counting**: The program accurately counts the occurrences of each unique word in the input text file.

- **Case Sensitivity**: You can choose whether the counting should be case-sensitive or case-insensitive.

- **Stopwords Removal**: If desired, you can specify a list of stopwords to be excluded from the word count. Stopwords are common words like "and," "the," "in" that are often excluded when analyzing text.

- **Exclusion List**: You can also specify a list of words to be excluded from the word count. This is useful if you want to exclude specific words from the analysis.

- **Efficiency**: The program efficiently processes large text files by reading them in chunks.
